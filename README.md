## About

Published the day after "a slight case of overbombing" for the reasons mentioned below.

Shortly after releasing my forth project on Art Blocks I was set to publish my second one on fxhash. A number of bot networks were spun up to watch my tezos wallet for activity, so they could swoop in and automatically buy "a slight case of overbombing" for flipping, on the believe that having been a recently published Art Blocks artist they may be some profit in it for them.

I noticed that the following day the bot networks were still set up to automatically buy anything I put out. Having previously written about the idea of making art specifically for the bot, extrapolating out a future where bots bought, traded and sold art without it ever being seen by a human I decided to put out a small project just for the bot network.

At the same time Twitter (when it was still called Twitter) added NFT integration where people could use one as their avatar. To differentiate it from a "normal" avatar it was placed in a hexagonal frame.

Figuring the bots on Twitter who were also buying art would want a natty new avatar I created the "Hexagones" with that use in mind.

It was all an elaborate joke, but with some art thinking behind it. The name "Hexagones" was because I knew they've very quickly be "gone", hex-a-gones.
